\chapter{Conclusion}
Our work is to make framework which is easy to use and can get improvement by using synergistic computation. In this paper, we use Halide as our language and make a runtime on Halide to build a synergistic and easy computing environment. 
According to our experiment, we could improve the execution time by splitting the workload into 2 or more partitions and dispatching them to CPU and GPU.  Also, our framework could get at most 1.55x speedup when processing case like Bilateral compared to fastest single device, but when processing algorithm like local laplacian we can get only few improvement when using static dispatch and may not get improvement when using dynamic dispatch because of the feature of the algorithm. However, even if we can get at most 1.55x speedup improvement, we still cannot get ideal performance improvement which we predict. But when kernel computing takes more percentage in the whole execution, in other word, when the algorithm become more complex, we could reduce the influence of OpenCL runtime and get more improvement.
In short, with the feature of Halide, we build a synergistic computing environment that is easy to program, tune performance and take advantage of both CPU and GPU to computing the jobs.
