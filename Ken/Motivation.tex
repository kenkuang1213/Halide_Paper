\chapter{Motivation}
\quad\ \ Nowadays, Graphics Processing Units (GPU) have become standard equipment for every computing devices, from mobile phones to supercomputers . When the computing power of Graphics Processing Units grows up, over the past few years, GPU is not only for graphic computing but also for general purpose data-parallel application. This has resulted in computing systems becoming “heterogeneous” - with multi-core CPUs and GPUs, with different capabilities being available for programmers to exploit.

However, it is still difficult to use multi-core CPUs and GPUs to process jobs synergistically which will cause that when CPUs is busy for processing tasks GPUs will be idle because all the tasks are assigned to CPUs. There are several research papers targeting on synergistically computing on both CPUs and GPUs by using Heterogeneous computing language like OpenCL. However, it’s not easy to program not to mention optimizing performance with same algorithm on different devices.
There is a new language Halide which can decouple algorithm from schedule making programmer easier to looking for best schedule on different devices, but it cannot execute same program on different devices. So we are going to introduce a new feature which can merge heterogeneous computing and easy programing by using Halide. With this feature we can run Halide program on both CPUs and GPUs at the same time to decrease execution time.
