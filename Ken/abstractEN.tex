In this thesis,we create a synergistic framework as Halide extension to build a better heterogeneous computing environment with the advantage of Halide.With our framework, when user input an image, we can dispatch workload into CPU and GPU to improve performance. Our framework support 2 methods - dynamic dispatch and static dispatch to assign different workload to CPU and GPU with those dispatch method we will get different level speedup.And we will measure those dispatch methods with different input sizes at mobile,ATI GPU and NVIDIA GPU.In our experiment, using our framework with optimized Halide CPU and GPU funciton can get 1.21x speedup at Nexus 7, 1.55x speedup at Inetel CPU with ATI GPU and 1.16x speedup at Intel CPU with Nvidia GPU.
